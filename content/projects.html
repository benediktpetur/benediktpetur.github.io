        <h2>Printer project</h2>
        <p>My printer project came about with a friend calling me up and asking me to make them a solution for there new printer.</p>
        <p>They just got a set of new thermal printers and the setup they were using with there old printers was out dated and had been jury rigged to work.</p>
        <p>So I made a simple solution for them to use with there new printers.</p>
        <p>It is a simple to use but a powerful printer app that currently has the functionality to print a preset layout and there logo along with fields where they can input the info they want.</p>
